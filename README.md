Almost done. There may be still some bugs but I'm working on it!


So far:
 - CSS parallax effect,
 jQuery:
 - hamburger menu,
 - sticky menu,
 - slider,
 - gallery works on jQuery plugin fancyBox https://github.com/fancyapps/fancyBox.
 - form check,



This site will be fully responsive. It is based on .psd (so I did all front-end work from scratch!).

Technologies used in this project:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS
- jQuery
- SASS
- RWD
- Gulp
